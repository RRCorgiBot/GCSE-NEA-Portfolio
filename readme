The main code block is 'cardmain.py' in the 'workinggame' folder
When finished, however, the code should be run from 'Card Game.py' also in the 'workinggame' folder
'scoretable.txt.' is where the top 5 scores will be stored, read, and re-written
The other files are mostly me just testing methods that could potentially be a solution 'readline test 1.py' and 'readline test 2.py' are the files I'm using to test different ways of reading from and writing to the 'scoretable.txt'
